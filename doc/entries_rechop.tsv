query_chain id	match chain id (CC)	match dom id (CATHEDRAL)	comments
5du3A	2oayA	4if8B01/1a7cA02	2 domains need to be treated as one
5e4vA	4co6B	4co6A01/na	Inherited incorrect WCD from 4co6B, inconsistent with pubmed:25108352
5b0oD	2dpyB	2dpyA/na	for some reasons the incorrect chain is not in CATH anymore, says holding pen (2dpyA is a match for CATH and doesn't exist)
na	9nseA	NA	this is a bad chopping, lots of fragments and secondary structure chopped in half, found by accident
NA	4e8dA	NA	doped_cath outlier
NA	3gw6D	NA	doped_cath outlier
5fmoL	1ny72	NA	doped_cath outlier, inherited from CathDomall, 2 consecutive domains incorrectly merged
5f22B	NA	NA	Really good chopclose SSAP score but the chopping is not good.
5fgzA	NA	NA	Good SSAP score for both Chopclose and Cathedral but chopping is weird.    
2naoD	2m9sA	NA	protein fibril monomer
5hsaB	NA	NA	Bad chopping results despite good SSAP scores
1dotA	1bxrC	NA	more detailed proposed for 1dotA. Trigger backwards update. 
NA	1pv4A	NA	From ISS search. A 2.40.50.140 domain containing a partial hitting 1.10.720.10.2. HMMsearch gives a bitscore of 41.6
2vgeA00			ISS 4_1_0 suspicious hit
