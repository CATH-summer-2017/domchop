pdbID	status	reason
		##This is where we keep a list of interesting domchops.Remember to keep the chain ID in pdbID 
		##Higher entries are older, lower entries are newer. (only true for {w} entries) 
		## Please use (Tab) button to separate fields, which essentially enters \t
		## Each line MUST contain 3 fields separated by 2 \tab, even if all 3 fileds are blank
		## Do not use quotes anywhere in the file cuz it breaks
## For example

##Chopped cases		
pdbID	status	reason
4txaA	w 	manual assignment
4w22K	a 	unpacked insertion in dom2
4rcnB	w 	incorrect cathedral rendering?
4rm6A	l 	Long repeated stacked beta sheets (non-globular).
5af3B	a 	Strong dom-dom interaction and multimerisation
5akpB	c	helical linker, dom-dom interaction rechopped,
4ye9A	r	strange case, most methods diagree4
5bmtB	r	CATHEDRAL and ChopClose failed on an easy case, while Puu and Domakdid good.
		
##Commented cases,		
4qslH	r	Cathedral produced very coarse chopping. ChopClose inherited fine chopping from a close homologue. Too much controversial and require a better Cathedral to make a decision.
4r04A	r,bp	Large beta-rich fragment at C-terminus require good templates for scanning method. Cathedral threw an spurious alignment for this region. *Dig literature, make refinement
4ufqA	r	Monomer of 3-chain MCD. Stacking instead of globular packing.
4rcnB	w	rasmol rendering problem
2mxvA	r	NMR structure. Coordinated by the Zinc ion that is ignored by the algo. Well packed though.
		
		
		
##Miruna		 
5a01C	r	CC result gives 5 domains. Ecod, however suggests, that the first 2 domains should be just one domain.
4zemB 	r 	CC results are really good. However, the second domain is IDS.
4zgvA 	r 	22-stranded transmembrane b-barrel that is difficult to chop
4zdyA 	w 	According to Cathedral the structure should be divided into 2 domains. Ecod suggests it's a single domain structure. I think Domain 1 should be removed as it is too unpacked (COAF).
5bu3A	w	Not sure about the helix that seems to be a connecting region between the barrels in the structure
5a60A	w	Incomplete structure- many gaps -  not sure if I should chop it
5by3A	w	Not sure if the 2 helices should be included in the yellow domain. Literature only gives residue detalis for second domain(158 to 459)
5ch6B	w	No clue
5chsA	w	Intereting structure. Literature doesn't help.
5a8lQ	w	I am not sure if the alpha helix that spans Domains 1 and 2 should be split or just COAF.
5ax7B	w	Results give 2 domains, I think it should be three. Literature not helping.
5cqrA	w	Compelx structute. Not sure how to chop it. RSSAs scores are pretty low.
5cqsD	c	This might be a single domain but I am not sure
5cusB	w	Not sure if this should be chopped.
5cslB	w	
4zxdW	w	Not sure about the tongue in Domain 2.

		
		
##Feng		
4ztcA	r 	Cathedral proposes an N-terminal structural tail is part of domian2, though topologically discontinuous
5a22A	c 	Cryo_EM, no sensible auto-result, *please add ECOD chopping.
4ug4D	r,bp 	Peripheral helixes *Check with nDOPE
4zzhA	r	not sure about proposed domain 1, might be too small and unpacked
4zphB	w	incorrect rendering, 2 hits to a single template
4zsxA	bp	Artificial fusion linker produced a partial Cathedral match! Checking literature.
2n53A	r	Better alternative PDB structure available.
5c9iA	r	Two manual proposal. Refer to 1C9P.
5ccbB	r	should we COAF insertion? should we include separate fragment?
5c76C	l	check the MCD helixes
5dgkB	c	
5awhA	c	
2n73B	w	need to correct my python script.
		
4qvgC	r	CC result show extension at C-terminal. Not sure whether to COAF.
4ze0A 	r  	Based on Cathedral Domain 1 (transmembrane region) was removed. Changed the boundaries of Domain 2 (COAF)
4ui9X	c 	Super-helix structure that is difficult to chop into domains. ECOD considers it to be single domain
		
		
##Ilya		
4zl4B	r	Algorithms are panicking, not agreeing with prodata either (visit the paper)
5bq9B	r	missing a big chunk of structure, however the domains are easy to see (just chop it)
5byhM	r	really unpacked protein, part of a big multichain complex, strange stuff (cut red in half, add blue helices to green)
5c6tA	r	not sure if I should include the linkers (remove the linkers)
5a63A	r	complicated case, hard to separate the domains, single helix is part of other MCD (separate 2 domains at 252, helix cut off)
5c6gA	r	part of a big MCD (its fine, chop according to Detective with refining boundaries)
5cvnA	c	not sure if proposed domain 1 needs to be chopped into smaller domains (no good match in CATH for domain 1)
5cwwB	r	looks like a WCD but maybe some parts need to be chopped off because they might be parts of MCD (it is a WCD)
5cwsK	r	this definetly doesnt belong in CATH but very nice to look at (chop off a sheet-helix-sheet as 1 domain)
3jb6A	c	found a chopping proposed in the article, seems plausible but I am not 100% sure.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5086257/
5d06A	c	complicated case, chopping based on paper is a bit strange, more info in the comment, unstructured extension of domain 2 binds the cofactor   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837477/
3jb9_	d	huge multi-chain spliceosome with 37 (!) chains, _ stands for X, Y, W, V, A, a, c for now, maybe more. very complex. (just chop it man)
5axwA	d	chopping is based purely on my common sense, because algorithms didnt provide good choppings and article is not available. more info in the comment. (find the article)
5dcaA	r	very big chain, results from CATHEDRAL and CC are not bad, however they contradict the article. at the same time domains from the article are too big and unpacked. more info in comments https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699386/
5d98A	r	no good chopping by algorithms, some structures may be parts of bigger MCD, chopping based on common sense
5aorA	r	based on paper, big chunks of structure missing, proposed domain added to 2 other domains due to being unpacked. not sure about tongues on domains 3 and 1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26545078
5dqrA	d	very tempting to treat it as a WCD (it is a WCD)
5du3A	r	again, very tempting to treat as a WCD but for some reason, it has really high SSAP scores with some bad choppings
5dvyA	d	domain boundary on the secondary structure, not sure (domains 2 and extend to to the yellow, end of 2 beta strands)
5dseA	w	suoerhelix, probably needs to be considered as a WCD
