pdbID	status	reason
		##This is where we keep a list of interesting domchops.Remember to keep the chain ID in pdbID 
		##Higher entries are older, lower entries are newer. (only true for {w} entries) 
		## Please use (Tab) button to separate fields, which essentially enters \t
		## Each line MUST contain 3 fields separated by 2 \tab, even if all 3 fileds are blank
		## Do not use quotes anywhere in the file cuz it breaks
## For example		
		5a01c \tab w \tab Bad CC results, to be discussed
##Chopped cases		
pdbID	status	reason
4txaA	w 	manual assignment
4w22K	w 	unpacked insertion in dom2
4rcnB	w 	incorrect cathedral rendering?
4rm6A	w 	Long repeated stacked beta sheets (non-globular).
5af3B	w 	Strong dom-dom interaction and multimerisation
5akpB	c	helical linker, dom-dom interaction rechopped,
4ye9A	r	strange case, most methods diagree
5bmtB	r	CATHEDRAL and ChopClose failed on an easy case, while Puu and Domakdid good.
		
##Commented cases,		
4qslH	w	Cathedral produced very coarse chopping. ChopClose inherited fine chopping from a close homologue. Too much controversial and require a better Cathedral to make a decision.
4r04A	w	Large beta-rich fragment at C-terminus require good templates for scanning method. Cathedral threw an spurious alignment for this region. *Dig literature, make refinement
4ufqA	w	Monomer of 3-chain MCD. Stacking instead of globular packing.
4rcnB	w	rasmol rendering problem
2mxvA	w	NMR structure. Coordinated by the Zinc ion that is ignored by the algo. Well packed though.
		
		
		
##Miruna		 
5a01C	r	CC result gives 5 domains. Ecod, however suggests, that the first 2 domains should be just one domain.
4zemB 	r 	CC results are really good. However, the second domain is IDS.
4zgvA 	r 	22-stranded transmembrane b-barrel that is difficult to chop
4zdyA 	w 	According to Cathedral the structure should be divided into 2 domains. Ecod suggests it's a single domain structure. I think Domain 1 should be removed as it is too unpacked (COAF).
5bu3A	w	Not sure about the helix that seems to be a connecting region between the barrels in the structure
5a60A	w	Incomplete structure- many gaps -  not sure if I should chop it
5by3A	w	Not sure if the 2 helices should be included in the yellow domain. Literature only gives residue detalis for second domain(158 to 459)
		
		
		
##Feng		
4ztcA	w 	Cathedral proposes an N-terminal structural tail is part of domian2, though topologically discontinuous
5a22A	c 	Cryo_EM, no sensible auto-result, *please add ECOD chopping.
4ug4D	w 	Peripheral helixes *Check with nDOPE
4zzhA	w	not sure about proposed domain 1, might be too small and unpacked
		
		
		
4qvgC	r	CC result show extension at C-terminal. Not sure whether to COAF.
4ze0A 	r  	Based on Cathedral Domain 1 (transmembrane region) was removed. Changed the boundaries of Domain 2 (COAF)
4ui9X	c 	Super-helix structure that is difficult to chop into domains. ECOD considers it to be single domain
		
		
##Ilya		
4zl4B	w	Algorithms are panicking, not agreeing with prodata either
5bq9B	w	missing a big chunk of structure, however the domains are easy to see
5byhM	w	really unpacked protein, part of a big multichain complex, strange stuff
#Symbols:		
	w	waiting for action
	r	resolved
	c	consulting Christine
