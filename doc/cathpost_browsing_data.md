Database browser, a good scenario for test-driven development (TDD)

#### Brief:
TDD was a brand new concept to me when I joined the group two weeks ago. The struggle against Django and MySQL shed precious light on this concept.
Any tool, any paradigm, must be providing some form of convenience to sustain its existence, so is the concept of TDD. ( A pragmatic statement from me). In other words, if you are feeling comfortable coding up about something, why would you even bother applying TDD?


* Think about it, if your code never breaks down, then you will never need TDD.

* Distinguish debug and TDD.

* Make good use of native error code



Today's blog post will try to summarise some principles in TDD while going through the joy and sorrow in creating a database browser, motivated by allowing for easier manual browsing of the data. We will talk through:

1. Trying to load data into MySQL and edit them in MySQL (and failed)
2. Trying to visualise the data using Django (partial success)
3. Trying to reconstruct the hierarchy of data fro children nodes. (two attempts)
