1. Data loading:
	Use INSERT in MySQL to load the hierarchy 
		a. load the whole s35 collection.
		b. add the requested domains only (cache)
			Test: How should the source file be formatted?

	Load the nDOPE score in some manner: pickle the score in some manner.
		a. On-request: Specify a collection of s35 that needs nDOPE score.
		b. Before filtering: all DOPEs need to be computed before we can filter on nDOPE.
			Test: i. check the integrity of DOPE score column: is there any blank or failed case?
				  Flag them up for further action.
				  ii. Test whether the module works on a specific collection of PDB (done!)
				  iii. Test whether retrival module works?
	Now we got all data already.
