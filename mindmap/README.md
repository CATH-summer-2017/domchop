The Goal is to create a mind map that could serve as a guide to DomChop.
Update according to solutions found during Domchop meetings.

**Common Cases**
A list of cases commonly found with a good SSAP score.
The cases are divided into categories, and should include the PDB file and the approach used to chop the structure.
eg. Ambiguous domain boundaries - 4ncdA - reduce the fragment length at the end of each domain

**Tricky Cases**

Cases that are a bit trickier usually with a low SSAP score
