## This is where we keep a list of interesting domchops.
## Remember to keep the chain ID in pdbID 

### Higher entries are older, lower entries are newer. (only true for "w" entries)


##Chopped cases
pdbID	reason
4txaA	w 	manual assignment
4w22K	w 	unpacked insertion in dom2
4rcnB	w 	incorrect cathedral rendering?
4rm6A	w 	Long repeated stacked beta sheets (non-globular). 
5af3B	w 	Strong dom-dom interaction and multimerisation


5akpB	c 	helical linker, dom-dom interaction	rechopped,
4ye9A	r 	strange case, most methods diagree	



##Commented cases, To be chopped
4qslH	w	Cathedral produced very coarse chopping. ChopClose inherited fine chopping from a close homologue. Too much controversial and require a better Cathedral to make a decision.
4r04A	w	Large beta-rich fragment at C-terminus require good templates for scanning method. Cathedral threw an spurious alignment for this region.
4ufqA	w	Monomer of 3-chain MCD. Stacking instead of globular packing.
4rcnB	w 	rasmol rendering problem
4ug4D	w 	Peripheral helixes
2mxvA	w 	NMR structure. Coordinated by the Zinc ion that is ignored by the algo. Well packed though.

5a01C	w 	CC result gives 5 domains. Ecod, however suggests, that the first 2 domains should be just one domain.
4zdyA 	w 	According to Cathedral the structure should be divided into 2 domains. Ecod suggests it's a single domain structure. I think Domain 1 should be removed as it is too unpacked (COAF).
4zemB 	w 	CC results are really good. However, the second domain is IDS.
4zgvA 	w 	22-stranded transmembrane b-barrel that is difficult to chop
4ztcA	w 	Cathedral proposes an N-terminal structural tail is part of domian2, though topologically discontinuous
5a22A	w 	Cryo_EM, no sensible auto-result



4qvgC	r	CC result show extension at C-terminal. Not sure whether to COAF.
4ze0A 	r  	Based on Cathedral Domain 1 (transmembrane region) was removed. Changed the boundaries of Domain 2 (COAF)
4ui9X	c 	Super-helix structure that is difficult to chop into domains. ECOD considers it to be single domain
